## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture

This project is a full-stack application built with a modern MERN-like stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), but with some key additions for its specific functionality. The architecture is designed for efficiency, scalability, and a great developer experience.

### Frontend 🎨

The frontend is a dynamic **Single-Page Application (SPA)** built to provide a fast and interactive user experience.

* **React (with Vite):** The core of our user interface is built with **React**, a powerful JavaScript library for creating component-based UIs. We use **Vite** as our build tool and development server, which offers a significantly faster development experience and optimized production builds compared to traditional bundlers.
* **Tailwind CSS:** Instead of writing traditional CSS, we use **Tailwind CSS**, a utility-first framework. This allows us to build complex, responsive layouts directly within our HTML (JSX) by composing utility classes. It helps maintain a consistent design system and speeds up development time.
* **Axios & React-PDF:** To communicate with our backend, we use **Axios**, a promise-based HTTP client that simplifies making API requests. For the core feature of displaying documents, **React-PDF** is used to render PDF files seamlessly within the browser, directly inside our React components.

---

### Backend ⚙️

Our backend is a robust RESTful API that handles business logic, data persistence, and security. It also intelligently delegates specialized tasks to a Python script.

* **Node.js & Express.js:** The server is built on **Node.js**, a JavaScript runtime that allows us to use JavaScript on the backend. We use **Express.js**, a minimal and flexible web framework, to handle routing, API endpoints, and middleware management.
* **MongoDB & Mongoose:** For our database, we chose **MongoDB**, a NoSQL document-oriented database known for its flexibility and scalability. We interact with it via **Mongoose**, an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library that provides a straightforward, schema-based solution for modeling our application data, enforcing validation, and managing business logic.
* **JSON Web Tokens (JWT):** Authentication is handled using **JWT**. When a user logs in, the server generates a secure, signed token. This token is then sent by the frontend with every subsequent request to access protected API routes, ensuring a stateless and secure authentication system.
* **Python (PyMuPDF) Integration:** For the heavy lifting of parsing PDFs, we leverage the power of Python. A dedicated Python script using the **PyMuPDF** library handles text extraction. When a user uploads a PDF, our Node.js server invokes this script (likely via a `child_process`), passing it the file. The Python script extracts the text and returns it to the Node.js server. This polyglot approach allows us to use the best tool for each specific job.

## 🚀 Deployment & DevOps

Our deployment is automated via a modern CI/CD pipeline, using a decoupled hosting strategy to optimize each part of the application for performance and scalability.

* **🌐 Vercel (Frontend):** The React SPA is deployed to **Vercel**, which leverages a **Global Edge Network** to ensure minimal latency for users worldwide. Deployments are automatically triggered from our Git repository.

* **⚙️ Render (Backend):** The Node.js API and its associated Python script are hosted on **Render** as a flexible **Web Service**. This allows us to manage our backend environment, scale resources as needed, and handle secrets securely.

* **🤖 GitHub Actions (CI/CD):** **GitHub Actions** orchestrates our pipeline. On every push to the `main` branch, it automatically runs tests and quality checks. Upon success, it triggers the production deployments on Vercel and Render, ensuring only validated code reaches users.
